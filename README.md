# qelp

A little Yelp clone. Built using Ruby on Rails, with testing from RSpec and Capybara. Postgres is the database of choice here. This was the foundation on which [Railstagram](https://github.com/henryaj/railstagram) was built, which is much more impressive (both technically and aesthetically).

I subsequently wrote the course material for this section of the Makers Academy course based on what I'd learned about Rails, the MVC design pattern, Postgres, testing with RSpec and Poltergeist, Devise and OmniAuth, Paperclip, and S3.

The course notes were based on the notes I took during this part of the course, which you can see [here](https://github.com/henryaj/makers-notes/blob/master/rails.md).
