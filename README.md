# qelp

A little Yelp clone. Built using Ruby on Rails, with testing from RSpec and Capybara. Postgres is the database of choice here. This was the foundation on which [Railstagram](https://github.com/henryaj/railstagram) was built, which is much more impressive (both technically and aesthetically).

## Technologies

* Ruby on Rails
* Postgres
* RSpec, Capybara and Poltergeist for testing
* Devise
* Paperclip and Imagemagick
